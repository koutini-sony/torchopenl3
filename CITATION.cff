abstract: "We describes the steps necessary to port OpenL3 audio embeddings(Cramer et al., 2019) 
           to PyTorch. We do regression tests to demonstate and elucidate differences between 
           themodels. The largest mean absolute error (<1eâˆ’3) occurs when using mel-spectrogramson 
           high-pitched frequency.
           Keywords:Audio Embedding, pytorch, Mel Spectrogram, Spectrogram"
