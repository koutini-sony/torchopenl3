abstract: "We describes the steps necessary to port OpenL3 audio embeddings1(Cramer et al., 2019)to PyTorch2.  We do regression tests to demonstate and elucidate differences between themodels.  The largest mean absolute error (<1eâˆ’3) occurs when using mel-spectrogramson high-pitched frequency.Keywords:Audio Embedding, pytorch, Mel Spectrogram, Spectrogram"
